# 10-SVG-Logo-Maker
  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-mit-blue) 
 ------------------
  ## Description

  The SVG Logo Maker uses the node.js command-line application to take in user input to generate a simple logo that saves as a SVG file.  The application prompts the user to select from one of three shapes (circle, triangle or square) and provide 3 characters for the text of the logo.   The user will be asked to input no more than 3 characters for their logo, and to input either a colour keyword or hexadecimal number for both their text colour & shape colour.  

Things I learned from this application:
* Further understanding of the Inquirer library to collect input from the user
* Using switch statements
* Using the Jest library to run tests on code
* How to use the constructor class, and how to extend it from parent to child
* How to create tests in Jest so that they fail, then pass, and how to construct a testing suite
